 * https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/description/
 *
 * Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
 * Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
 * Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
 * Output: [[1,5]]
 * Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considerred overlapping.
